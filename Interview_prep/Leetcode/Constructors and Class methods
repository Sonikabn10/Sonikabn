/*Why do we need class methods and contructors?
When multiple objects are created, there is a repeatation of the code in order to provide values to these different objects of a code.
Inorder to avoid repeatation, constructors and class methods are introduced.

What are constructors?
These are special methods that are invoked each time an object of a specific class is created. 
Meaning, that method is going to be invoked at the construction of an object of a class.

Rules: 
1. Same name as the class.
2. Does not have a return type.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

//example of a initialization list for a constructor:


#include <iostream>
#include <list>
using namespace std;

class Company{
public:
    string Name;
    int EmployeeCount;
    string City;
    string Owner;
    string ProductType;
    int AnnualRevenue;
    list<string>Products;
    
    
    Company(string name, int employeecount, string owner, list<string>products):Name(name),EmployeeCount(employeecount),Owner(owner), Products(products){
        
        AnnualRevenue=0;//default value
    }
};


int main() {
    list<string>prod={"steel","sand"};
    Company SBN("SBN",200,"Sonika",prod);
    //SBN.Name="SBN";
    //SBN.EmployeeCount=200;
    //SBN.City="California";
    //SBN.Owner="Sonika";
    //SBN.ProductType="Construction";
    //SBN.AnnualRevenue=15000000;
    //SBN.Products= {"Bitumen","Cement","Steel","Sand","Granite"};
    
    cout<<"Name of the Company: "<<SBN.Name<<endl;
    cout<<"Employee Count:"<<SBN.EmployeeCount<<endl;
    cout<<"Owner:"<<SBN.Owner<<endl;
    cout<<"Revenue:"<<SBN.AnnualRevenue<<endl;
    for(string prod:SBN.Products){
        cout<<prod<<endl;
    }


}

What are class methods?
