/*what is a function?
>A block of code which performs a certain task which can be reused by invoking the function.
>Main function is the only function that does not require invoking.
>Execution starts from the first line of the function and ends where there is a return value or the end of the function. 
>C++ is compliled and executed from top to bottom in a procedural manner. Hence compile time error/ build error (function identifier not found) is shown if a function is not defined/ declared before it is invoked in the main function


What is function declaration and function definition?
>Declaration gives your compiler info about your function. It has to be declared before the start of your main function.

Ex: void functionintro(int age, string city);

Definition can be done anywhere in the code and if defined before the main function, the function does not need to be declared in the start. 
Ex: void function intro(int age, string city){
cout<<"My age is"<<age<<endl;
cout<<"My city is"<<city<<endl;

}

What are paramters and arguments?
If there are specific varibales that have to used in a function to perform a particular task, these are declared as parameters while defining/declaring a function.
While invoking these functions, the values that are given to these arguments are called arguments.

NOTE: Argument names while invoking a function need not be the same as the one in the function definition.

What are default arguments?
If a variable doesnt have a value declared during invoking that function, those variables are specified with default values while defining these parameters.
NOTE: If you mention a default value for a parameter which is inbetween a list, an error which says default argument not at the end of the list. 
The end of the list varibale should always have a default value if a default value is given to any parameter in the function definition.
The function argument cannot be left empty for any parameter without a default value. An error will be thrown/ build error.

//Example code for a function
//Example1:
void name(string name, int age);//function declaration.
int main() {
    cout<<"THIS IS THE MAIN FUNCTION\n";
    name("Lola",24);

    
}

void name(string name, int age){
    cout<<"My name is:"<<name<<"\n";
    cout<<"My age is:"<<age<<endl;
}

output:THIS IS THE MAIN FUNCTION
My name is:Lola
My age is:24



//Example 2:
//void name(string name, int age=0);//function declaration.
void display(string name, int age=0){
    cout<<"My name is:"<<name<<"\n";
    if(age!=0)
    cout<<"My age is:"<<age<<endl;
}
int main() {
    cout<<"THIS IS THE MAIN FUNCTION\n";
    string name1;
    int age1;
    cout<<"Enter your name:";
    cin>> name1;
    cout<<"Enter your age:";
    cin>> age1;
    //name("Lola");
    display(name1,age1);
    
    //extraction operator>>used to extract data out of the variable-used in cin
    //insertion operator << used to insert data into the variable -used in cout
output:
THIS IS THE MAIN FUNCTION
Enter your name:Lola
Enter your age:24
My name is:Lola
My age is:24
// \n:newline, character, occupies memory space, flushes the output buffer at the end of the program, used when many output values have to be executed
// endl: newline, manipulator, occupies no memory space, flushes the output buffer immediately, used for immediate execution
